# Fourier

This is a small project inspired by _The Coding Train_'s [Coding Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms) on the Discrete Fourier Transform. 

The goal of this small project was to create an Electron app and use both Python and JavaScript for the implementation of the code. Even though it isn't necessary for a project like this to use so many different technologies, it was one of the aims to gain experience working with them and combine all technologies in order to create an app that uses Python as backend and web technologies as frontend.
